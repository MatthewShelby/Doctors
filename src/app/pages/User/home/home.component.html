                        <label>Lorem ipsum : </label>
                        <p class="par"> In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly
                              used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on
                              meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is
                              available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which
                              allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of
                              the text influencing the design.

                              Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of 'De finibus bonorum et malorum', a 1st
                              century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added,
                              and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin.

                              Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s,
                              when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets.[1] Lorem ipsum was
                              introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed it in graphic and
                              word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. Other popular word
                              processors, including Pages and Microsoft Word, have since adopted Lorem ipsum,[2] as have
                              many LaTeX packages,[3][4][5] web content managers such as Joomla! and WordPress, and CSS
                              libraries such as Semantic UI.[6] </p>
